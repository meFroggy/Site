## About me

Hello, I am Siren--creator of Mermaids mod--a Hytale developer. A couple of months before Hytale's release, I decided to make a mermaid mod, which is where my journey began with Hytale modding. I even chose my username, Siren, from this decision. The mermaids mod wasn't the first mod that I made. It was Siren's Commands (at that time, it was called Mermaids' Commands), which was a shortcut to many commands. It was tough for me to make this mod because there were no guides, and I had no clear idea, which is why I paused working on that mod and decided to tackle my Mermaids mod. This was probably the best decision I could have made because I learned so much about Hytale modding every hour I spent working on Mermaids. I just continued working on the Mermaids mod, which led me to learn so many different mechanics about Hytale modding that let me branch off into other mods. The Mermaids mod remains my passion for modding in Hytale and will continue to be my #1 most worked-on mod.
