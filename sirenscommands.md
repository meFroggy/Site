### Welcome to the Official [Siren's Commands](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/sirenscommands) Mod Wiki!

Siren's Commands adds multiple useful commands to your server. This is more of a personal plugin with commands I use to simplify my experience using Hytale.


#### Commands:

| Command: | Description: |
|:---|:---|
| /sirenscommands and /scmds | View all of Siren's Commands that are available. |
| /list and /players | See a list of all connected player on the server. |
| /gmc and /gma | Set your gamemode quicker. |
| /top | Teleports the player to the surface. |
| /sucide and /die | Kills the player. |
| /back | Teleports the player to their previous location. |
| /day and /night | More accurate time to set for day or night. |
