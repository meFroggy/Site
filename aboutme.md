\### About me

Hello, I am Siren--creator of Mermaids mod--a Hytale developer. A couple months before Hytale release, I have decided to make a mermaids mod which is where my journey began with Hytale modding. I even choose my username Siren from this decision. The mermaids mod wasn't the first mod that I made. It was Siren's Commands (at that time was called Mermaids's Commands) which was shortcuts to many commands. It was tough for me to make this mod because there were no guides and I had no clear adjective which is why I paused working on that mod and decided to tackle my Mermaids mod. This was probably the best decision I could do because I learned so much about Hytale modding every hour I spent working on Mermaids. I just continued and continued working on Mermaids mod, which led me to learn so many different mechanics about Hytale modding that let me branch off into other mods. The Mermaids mod is still my passion for modding in Hytale and will still be my #1 most worked on mod.
